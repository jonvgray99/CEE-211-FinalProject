    "    - Every row is when the whole plant was out of production - dont want this yet, want to filter out these events except \"failed\". The removed ones are ones that left crusher in standby (not a failure)\n",

    "Need to keep crusher standby data because data is unlabeled so after cleaning we synchronize by start and end of time stamp if time is within range of first two rows therefore the label is whatever it is in the other. If we get to end and dont find a range where this timestamp belongs that means that the crusher was not failed was not standby and should add operating label. If we delete or drop all standby we overestimate the number of times the crusher was operational. Overestimating frequency of the normal condition of the crusher. sync after all filtering.\n",
