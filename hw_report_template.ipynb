If you want to change the title and author lines in the output pdf, see here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66929384/add-notebook-author-and-title-in-jupyter-notebook-cells>. You can open Advanced Tools and edit Notebook metadata with the gear icon in the top right of Jupyter Lab. These steps aren't required, but it would make your report prettier.\n",
